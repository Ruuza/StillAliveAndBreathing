# StillAliveAndBreathing
My first game, it was a school project.

It's not finished and it's more of an experiment than the actual game.

## How to install (windows only)

  1. Go to releases on the githum project page and download the newest .7z file with the game
  2. Extract the game
  3. run SAAB.exe
  4. Play
